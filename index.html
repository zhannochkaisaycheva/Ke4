                                                    ‘I’m thankful to those people who called me fat and looked down at me. If it hadn’t been for
                                                    them, I’d still be a fatso!’ says Nina Hubert,
                                                    <strong> who lost 26 kilos. </strong> On her path to a beautiful body she tried a whole bunch
                                                    of various diets, but
                                                    <strong> the simplest method </strong> turned out the most effective one.
                                                    <strong> Nina told in details all about this method </strong> which also prevents the process
                                                    of weight regain. Here is her captivating story…
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I’ve never been a fragile girl, but excess
                                                    weight didn’t make me self-conscious. When I met my future husband Mark, I relaxed, and I came
                                                    to my senses only when I realized I’d become really fat. </p>
<blockquote>
<span> When I met Mark, I relaxed, and I came to my senses only when I realized I’d become
                                                        really fat.</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I’ve been in a relationship with Mark for more
                                                    than 7 years, we have two beautiful kids. But until recently we were, as they say it, "living
                                                    apart together". Mark lived in his own apartment, he worked a lot, and visited me
                                                    occasionally. Then he left again. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> From the very beginning of our relationship I
                                                    constantly waited for him to propose to me. This was my dream! </p>
<blockquote>
<span> When will he finally propose? This was my dream!</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> When I got pregnant for the first time, I
                                                    thought now we would get married for sure. But no such luck. Mark kept visiting me, I kept
                                                    waiting for him… </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> When our elder son was born, we were very
                                                    happy. He adopted the baby, surrounded me with care and helped me with everything. I could
                                                    feel that he loved us, but it was his special way of love. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> My son had his second birthday, we decided to
                                                    have a 2-week trip to the seaside together. The sea, the sun and the sand. I missed vacation
                                                    so much! </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Dubai offered us a nice hotel, warm beach and
                                                    ‘all included’ meals, it was a perfect option for us. </p>
<p></p>

<img src="il6.jpg">

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> On the beach I suddenly noticed that Mark spent
                                                    a lot of time watching one girl. I said nothing but I just decided to watch him too. At first
                                                    I thought that he fell in love at first sight. But later he changed the object of his
                                                    observation and started watching another girl, then another girl, and it never ended! </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I was furious! My son and I as though didn’t
                                                    exist. </p>
<blockquote>
<span> Suddenly it struck me that he just liked skinny girls!</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I never wanted to look like a jealous fool,
                                                    that’s why I tried to calm down and analize. I quickly understood that all these girls he’d
                                                    been watching shared one quality - they were twice slimmer than me! The thought struck me like
                                                    a thunderbolt. He just likes skinny girls! Maybe that was the underlying reason for his
                                                    behaviour in our relationship??? </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I had one photo where he was holding me in his
                                                    arms looking at yet another ‘skinny girl’, have a look: </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Mark never told me he didn’t like my figure. He
                                                    never asked me to lose weight, nothing of the kind. But there was no marriage proposal either,
                                                    the one which I longed for so much. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> These thoughts kept me uptight, I coped with
                                                    the stress thanks to the all-you-can-eat buffet. During those 2 weeks I ate like there were
                                                    three of me. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Upon my return from vacation, I weighed myself
                                                    and was shocked. Together with my suntan, I brought from the sunny Dubai 9,5 kilos. I was on
                                                    the point of having a nervous breakdown.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I started to study the internet searching for
                                                    slimming topics, but a few weeks later I found out I was pregnant for the second time! My
                                                    vacation was fruitful in all senses of the word. Obviously, in my condition I stopped thinking
                                                    about weight loss, my mind was elsewhere...
                                                </p>
<blockquote>
<span> Anyway, I kept suspecting that Mark didn’t like me as a woman.</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I couldn’t stop thinking that Mark didn’t like
                                                    me as a woman. I almost decided to do abortion. I’m very glad that Mark forbade me
                                                    categorically even to think about it. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> So, we had our second baby, another son. The
                                                    history repeated. Mark adopted the baby and he surrounded us with care, love and attention.
                                                    But only when he was around. There wasn’t a single thing that belonged to him in my apartment,
                                                    apart from his toothbrush, so I kept focusing on children, that was my way of dealing with the
                                                    situation. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> When I stopped breastfeeding, thoughts about
                                                    losing weight started to torture me again. I couldn’t forget about that vacation, I could see
                                                    Mark’s admiring eyes fixed on skinny girls, and nothing changed in our relationship. I still
                                                    weighed 88 kilos. </p>
<blockquote>
<span> I weighed 88 kilos then. So I decided!</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> So I decided it was time to change! I tried all
                                                    kind of stuff: diets, maybe, a dozen of them, different fitness programs, body wraps, special
                                                    massages, etc, etc. All these things either didn’t help at all or helped only temporarily - as
                                                    soon as weight was gone, it came back in a flash.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I met a girl,
                                                    <strong> Amy, </strong> in a pastry,
                                                    <strong> store, </strong> she was one of the girls who gave birth in the same maternity
                                                    hospital together with me when I had my second child. I could hardly recognize her, she used
                                                    to be half as much bigger than me and now she was
                                                    <strong> almost 3 times smaller </strong> than after the delivery!!!
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "Incredible!", I blurted out excitedly instead
                                                    of greeting her. "I can’t believe my own eyes! Amy, is that really you?!" </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "I’m a bit skinnier than I used to be, aren’t
                                                    I?" she said to me smiling, while buying a few brownies. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "And you eat pastry too?! How do you pull that
                                                    off? How??? I tried sport, and dieting, and saunas and stuff, I tried everything! I could
                                                    reach minus 3 kilos tops for a week or two, which was followed by a 7 kilo regain!" I almost
                                                    cried out, I remember this moment clearly because people in the store started staring at me.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "Nina, what diet, what saunas, are you out of
                                                    your mind? I have an idea. Let’s go to my place and have a chat, my husband is at work now,
                                                    we’ll have a cup of tea and talk. I’ll treat myself to these cakes, and you can drink some hot
                                                    water," exclaimed Amy, giving me a merry somewhat cunning look. "I’ll tell you everything,
                                                    I’ll show it to you and even give you some to try." </p>
<blockquote>
<span> "Nina, what diet, what saunas, are you out of your mind?"</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I was awfully intrigued and I agreed at once.
                                                    Besides, Mark was to go on a business trip the next day for two weeks, that’s why he dedicated
                                                    the last moments before leaving to the children and I had some time to myself. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;">
<strong> Amy lost 33 kg </strong> virtually in 3.5 months as soon as she stopped
                                                    breastfeeding. She wasn’t on a diet, there was no fasting and no gym. She led her usual
                                                    lifestyle and didn’t limit herself in anything. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Her
                                                    <strong> body became slim like that of a young girl. </strong> Weirdly enough, such a big
                                                    weight loss didn’t leave
                                                    <strong> any stretch marks on her skin. </strong> I thought Mark would surely enjoy gazing at
                                                    her. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I felt the strongest emotions when I learnt
                                                    <strong> how easily </strong> she reached it all, how easy and safe

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I remember too well the hell I had to go
                                                    through when trying to lose hateful kilos. This was a nightmare! I could remember the
                                                    depression I felt when being on a diet, and our constant quarrels with Mark, my nervous
                                                    breakdowns and how I started to eat everything without stopping when I fell off the wagon.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> It was even upsetting, given all I had to go
                                                    through, to see that it had no sense and that
                                                    <strong> one should lose weight differently. </strong> It’s a shame, but I coped with the
                                                    feeling because right now I knew for certain just what exactly I needed to do. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Now listen
                                                    <strong> attentively </strong> to what Amy said to me! </p>
                                                  
<!-- <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> When we arrived, Amy treated me with latte. It
                                                    was no ordinary latte, it was black. At first I was surprised, but the taste of the drink
                                                    turned out just like ordinary coffee with a strong foamed milk. It was very delicious. </p> -->

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> We exchanged phone numbers and I left. I spent
                                                    1.5 hours at Amy’s. At the time I had no idea that these 1,5 hours would eventually turn my
                                                    life around… </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I rushed home full of determination. I turned
                                                    on the computer in an instant and ordered <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a> on the site Amy gave
                                                    me. In three days the coveted package was delivered and I started on my journey! </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I weighed myself.
                                                    <strong> The scale showed 88.4 kilos </strong>. From that day on, my every morning always included one cup of Organic TeaTox . </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> The next day I stepped on the scale again -
                                                    88.5 kg. Plus 100 grams! To say that I was upset is to say nothing. I panicked. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I started to call Amy.
                                                </p>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> So I kept drinking it. I didn’t make any
                                                    special changes in my usual nutrition, I just drank one cup of <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a>
                                                    every morning. I was so interested to know what would happen next. I still didn’t believe I’d
                                                    start dropping weight without changing anything in my diet and lifestyle. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> On day 6 I came up to the scale, my legs
                                                    trembling with anxiety, I got on it and closed my eyes. I was afraid to look at it, but in a
                                                    couple of seconds I opened my eyes sharply. The scale showed 83,3 kilos. </p>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I learnt those first success numbersby heart.
                                                    It was incredible! My heart pounded in my chest, I could hardly breathe from excitement!
                                                    <strong> I made it!!!! </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> My menu for the next week didn’t differ at all
                                                    from my usual one. Except for one thing -
                                                    <strong> every day I drank a cup </strong> of my favourite <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a>.

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I forbade myself to check my weight, but even
                                                    without the scale I could feel I was losing it. Sometimes I felt pleasant warmth in arms,
                                                    stomach, and thighs. I had an immense amount of energy, I hadn’t had it for so long. My
                                                    constant fatigue vanished. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> When I got on the scale a week later, I almost
                                                    fainted. It showed 74,4 kilos. Meaning

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Just imagine yourself all of a sudden many
                                                    kilos slimmer. Imagine the way you feel. Imagine how good it feels when you like yourself.
                                                    Then you’ll understand what I felt at that moment. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Surely, I noticed my clothes looked too loose
                                                    on me. But I had no idea I had actually dropped 14 kg

</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> It was two days before Mark’s arrival.
                                                    Picturing Mark’s reaction to the changes, I felt as though I had grown wings and could fly
                                                    like a butterfly. The children also looked forward to meeting their dad and getting presents
                                                    he would always bring from his business trips.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> On the day of Mark’s arrival we cooked a
                                                    festive dinner, prepared some exquisite meals and I even baked his favourite cake called
                                                    Prague, the one which I hadn’t made for ages. I wasn’t afraid of eating sweet foods anymore!
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Mark arrived the moment we laid the table.
                                                    Hearing the sound of the door opening, the children rushed to the hall to meet their daddy.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> The door was flung open, Mark was standing on
                                                    the porch with a giant bunch of flowers and boxes with toys for kids. The boys rushed to their
                                                    dad,
                                                    <strong> he cast a glance at me over the children"s heads and opened his mouth. </strong> The
                                                    boxes fell from his hands. Down went the flowers too. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> The children were jumping with joy examining
                                                    their presents, while Mark, still unable to avert eyes from me, bent over to pick up the
                                                    flowers. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> A few seconds later we were standing alone in
                                                    the hall. Mark was standing still with the flowers, like he was enchanted or something. I
                                                    burst out laughing and took the bouquet from his hands. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "Is something wrong? Come on in!"
                                                </p>
<blockquote>
<span> "You… What happened to you...How???" Mark couldn’t come to his senses.</span>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "Are you going to kiss me or will you just keep
                                                    standing there?" </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Mark suddenly grabbed me, lifted me in the air
                                                    and started to kiss me while I kept laughing. He was glowing with happiness,
                                                    <strong> I could feel that he adored the way I looked </strong>. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "That’s enough, put me down to the floor, let’s
                                                    wash hands and have dinner together!" </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> In the evening Mark acted tense, when I put the
                                                    kids to bed he pounced at me as though it was our first time. It was a hot night of
                                                    <strong> insane love-making, </strong> I couldn’t remember the last time
                                                    <strong> I felt so desired. </strong> Completely exhausted, we fell asleep when it started to
                                                    dawn. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> The next morning Mark suggested that we have a
                                                    family trip to the seaside together, for 10 days. They sealed some important successful deal
                                                    the other day at work and they were given a few days off with a bonus payment as a reward.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;">
<strong> I was over the moon with joy, </strong> I had never felt so happy in my life! </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> At the time I worked as an accountant in
                                                    several firms, I worked mainly at home. There was nothing urgent coming that week, I could
                                                    easily leave for a week or two so I agreed without hesitation. The kids were thrilled - they
                                                    were so excited to go to the sea! </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> This time we chose Tunisia. It was a
                                                    two-bedroom room in a four-star hotel. The tour included unlimited meals, which was a great
                                                    testing for my secret recipe! I was also eager to see how Mark would behave when we get there.

                                                    servings, didn’t want to eat a lot.
                                                    <strong> Surely, I never forgot to drink a cup of </strong> <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a>.

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Late in the evening, when our kids fell asleep
                                                    after having a fun day full of playing and swimming, Mark and I drank wine, cuddling on the
                                                    balcony of our hotel room, we talked and looked at the moon. Then Mark would take me in his
                                                    hands and went to the bedroom where we made love with the kind of passion we had never had
                                                    since the day when we met each other. It happened every day.
                                                    <strong> I felt I could die of happiness! </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> The last night before the departure, standing
                                                    on the balcony, Mark asked me to close my eyes. I did and I could hear him going to the room
                                                    and coming back. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "Open your eyes!" said Mark excitedly.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I opened. Mark was standing on his right knee
                                                    in front of me. He was holding a golden ring in his hands. </p>
<blockquote>
<span> "Will you marry me?"
                                                        <br> For a second, I lost my vision. I waited for these words during all those long 7 years!
                                                    </span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I waited for them every day. I dreamt about
                                                    them, I imagined so many times how he said them. I felt my eyes quickly filling with tears.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "Are you serious?" I didn’t find better words.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> "I totally am! You are the best, the most
                                                    beautiful and
                                                    <strong> I want you to be my wife. </strong> For real! I don’t want to come and go anymore. I
                                                    want us to always live together!"
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> I burst out crying, threw myself at his neck
                                                    and whispered through the tears:
                                                    <strong> ‘Yes, I will!’ </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> As soon as we arrived home, we went to the City
                                                    Hall and submitted an application. </p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> So much was happening in my life so I just
                                                    utterly forgot about my weight problem. This time, I dropped 7.5 kilos during a vacation with
                                                    all-inclusive meals and
                                                    <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a>. It wasn’t 1 kilo a day anymore, but to be frank, I ate more
                                                    than usual when I was there. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Afterwards, I didn’t even try to lose weight. I
                                                    kept drinking <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a> every second day. This didn’t prevent me from
                                                    <strong> losing another 5 kilos by the wedding </strong>. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Our marriage ceremony was a great fun, Amy was
                                                    my witness, I had made good friends with her by that time. I was immensely grateful to her
                                                    <strong> for this incredibly simple weight loss recipe </strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<span> Later Mark admitted that he secretly always wished that I was skinny.</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> He said my transformation
                                                    <strong> drove him crazy. </strong> He said that he secretly always wanted me to be slim,
                                                    <strong> just the way I was now. </strong> Surely, he never told me that, because he didn’t
                                                    want to offend me. He is very considerate, my husband! </p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;">
<strong> P.S. </strong> It’s been 3 months since Mark and I are officially husband and wife.
                                                    Our next step is selling our apartments to buy a big house where we will be comfortable
                                                    together. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Now
                                                    <strong> I weigh 62 kilos and 300 grams and my weight remains the same </strong> even though I
                                                    stopped drinking <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a> a month ago. In total,
                                                    <strong> I lost 26 kilos and 100 g </strong> and after 7 years of being in a relationship, we
                                                    are still deeply in love.
                                                    <strong> This is a fantastic feeling, I’m telling you, and I feel that I earned it! </strong>

<span> I dropped 26 kilos and 100g. My dream has come true!</span>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;">
<strong> My dream has come true! </strong> My dream has come true! It happened even better
                                                    than I dreamt! Yes, it was a chance that helped me, when I met Amy. It was just a chance. And
                                                    I used it. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> Such
                                                    <strong> chances appear in the lives of every one of us, </strong> although they are really
                                                    rare. Many of us, preoccupied with our daily routine, chasing for money and feeling the lack
                                                    of trust to the world just fail to see these chances.
                                                </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> My advice: Try to always catch your chance in
                                                    everything: any events happening in your life, some people whom you meet in your life for some
                                                    reason, stories which you happen to read for some reason, everything! When you understand that
                                                    it means something -
                                                    <strong> don’t wait, grab your chance! </strong> This is a secret to
                                                    <strong> achieving life’s greatest happiness </strong>. After using your chance,
                                                    <strong> you will see how much better your life has become </strong> in a way you can’t even
                                                    imagine. </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> After listening to Amy’s story, I also thought
                                                    at first that it was a fib. But I still tried her recipe, that <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a>,
                                                    because we can’t know anything for sure until we try it. I could have acted like a big sceptic
                                                    and just walk past that and my life would be a mess. At best, nothing would have changed!
                                                    Moreover, I’d never know that I missed my chance… </p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 27px;"> For those who firmly decided to become really
                                                    happy, beautiful, attractive and insanely desired, I will do the thing Amy once did for me
                                                    when I met her. I’ll show you where you can find that site of the <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a> manufacturer which she told me about.
                                                    <strong> Just click the green button </strong> ‘GO TO THE MANUFACTURER’S SITE’ below and it
                                                    will open. All the rest is in your hands. </p>

<p> It’s her own fault! What was she thinking about, letting herself go till she weighed 90 kilos?
                                                No wonder her lover looked at other women. I never gained so much, but I also dropped with the

<p> I read everything and came to the conclusion that people are blocked and don’t see the obvious
                                                even when they look in the mirror. Hence the problems. I also used to be this way, I gained a
                                                lot of overweight, then I used this <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a>. The result is minus 19
                                                kilos. True that many start torturing themselves with diets or sport, only because they don’t
                                                believe in different remedies. But you’ll never know till you try yourself. </p>

<p> Alkana, my mother lost 12 kilos with it at the age of 59, she’s almost like me now. So no

<p> My wife and I lost weight with <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a> together. She ordered it the
                                                moment it appeared in our country. As a result, she dropped 13 and I 18. She looks like a model
                                                now, no sagging. As for me, my beer belly disappeared, I even miss it! </p>

<p> I lost 12 kilos after a month, another 8 in two months, now I’m finishing my second <a href="http://eh5s1.doctorpix.com/l"> Organic TeaTox </a> course. I think that by the end of this course total weight loss
                                                will be about 25 kilos. I guess this is a great result for less than three months. Don’t believe
                                                this nonsense that you can’t lose weight without a diet.
